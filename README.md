# Harmonic Swarm Intelligence (HSI)

## Overview
**Harmonic Swarm Intelligence (HSI)** is a novel AI framework that integrates **wave-based computation, swarm intelligence, and dynamic multi-sensory perception** to explore and interpret hyperdimensional structures. Inspired by **echolocation, harmonic resonance, and emergent intelligence**, HSI enables **autonomous agent swarms** to collaboratively map and interact with complex environments in ways traditional AI cannot.

## Key Features
- **Multi-Sensory Swarm Agents:** Each agent possesses unique sensory capabilities, including **frequency analysis, wave interference detection, topological distortion sensing, and geometric measurement.**
- **Acoustic Intelligence:** Unlike conventional AI, HSI **perceives** its environment via **wave-based exploration**, utilizing **resonance mechanics** to interpret complex spaces.
- **Swarm Queen Optimization:** A central decision-making entity **analyzes agent feedback**, refines perception, and directs swarm behavior for **optimal convergence**.
- **Meta-Learning & Adaptation:** The system dynamically **adjusts agent weights**, prioritizing high-confidence sensory inputs and recalibrating underperforming agents.
- **Hyperdimensional Exploration:** Designed for **4D+ problem spaces**, HSI excels in understanding structures that defy Euclidean intuition.
- **Scalable & Open-Source:** Built with **Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, and SciPy**, making it extensible for research and practical applications.

## Installation
To use **Harmonic Swarm Intelligence**, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/richardaragon/harmonicswarmintelligence.git
cd harmonic-swarm-intelligence
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run a simulation using the default **hyperdimensional structure** and **multi-agent swarm:**

```bash
python run_simulation.py
```

### Configuration
You can modify simulation parameters in `config.py`:

```python
NUM_AGENTS = 16  # Number of agents in the swarm
DIMENSION = 4    # Dimensionality of the explored space
STEPS = 100      # Number of simulation steps
VISUALIZE_EVERY = 20  # Frequency of visualization updates
```

## How It Works
1. **Agents Probe the Environment:** Each agent emits wave-like signals and records responses based on its sensory type.
2. **Swarm Queen Processes Feedback:** The Queen **evaluates agent confidence**, adjusts weights, and refines the **global model**.
3. **Exploration & Adaptation:** Agents move dynamically, **seeking optimal resonance interactions** with the structure.
4. **Convergence & Mapping:** Over time, the system **constructs an accurate model** of the hyperdimensional shape.

## Visualizing Results
HSI includes built-in **3D and 2D visualizations** to track agent movements, convergence metrics, and knowledge accumulation.

```python
from hsi.visualization import plot_results
plot_results('simulation_output.json')
```

## Applications
